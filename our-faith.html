                <h2>Our Tenets Of Faith</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h5>The Holy Scriptures</h5>
                        We believe the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the verbally inspired Word of God, written by men in God’s control, inerrant and infallible in the original manuscripts, and the final authority in faith and life. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>The Godhead</h5>
                        We believe in one, true and living God, eternally existing in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. These three being identical in essence, equal in power and glory, and having precisely the same attributes and perfections, being the Creator and Supreme Ruler of the universe, the heavens, the earth and all the things herein.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>The Condition of Man</h5>
                        We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God in innocence and without sin, but that in Adam’s sin the race fell, inherited a sinful nature, became spiritually dead and alienated from God, and now man by himself is incapable of remedying his lost and depraved condition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>The Person and Work of Christ</h5>
                        We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man without ceasing to be God, conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin. He died voluntarily as a sinless substitutionary sacrifice on the cross, thereby satisfying God’s righteous judgment against sin. After substantiating the accomplishment of that redemption by His bodily resurrection from the grave, He ascended to the right hand of his Father where He intercedes on behalf of those who trust Him.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit</h5>
                        We believe that the Holy Spirit is the Divine Person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, that He alone brings new life to those who are spiritually dead, that He baptizes (or places) all believers into the one true Church, which is the Body of Christ, that He indwells them permanently, seals them unto the day of redemption, bestows spiritual gifts upon them and fills (or controls) those who are yielded to Him.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Salvation</h5>
                        We believe that salvation is the gift of God’s grace. It cannot be gained by meritorious works, but is freely bestowed upon all who put their faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ at Calvary. All who so trust the Savior are forgiven of their sins and born into the family of God by the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>The Church</h5>
                        We believe that all those who are born again in this present age comprise the true Church of Jesus Christ, and that only those who are members of the true Church shall be eligible for membership in the local church, gathered together for worship, fellowship and service of God, recognizing the need for mutual counsel and cooperation with other bodies of like faith.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>The Ordinances</h5>
                        We believe that our Lord Jesus Christ instituted two ordinances to be observed by all believers until His return: Believer’s Baptism and the Lord’s Supper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Christian Life</h5>
                        We believe that the life of the believer is to be separated from worldliness by consistent conduct before God and man, and is to be in the world as life-giving light.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Marriage</h5>
                        We believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>The Second Coming of Christ</h5>
                        We believe in the personal, imminent coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for His Church and His subsequent premillennial return to earth to establish His Kingdom.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>The Eternal State</h5>
                        We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead and judgment of all, the unsaved shall suffer everlasting and conscious punishment and the saved shall enjoy everlasting life in the presence of God.
